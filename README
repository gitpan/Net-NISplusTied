README for Net::NISplusTied
---------------------------

The Net::NISplusTied allows you to treat NIS+ tables as if they were perl
hashes, using tie() semantics.  It has cultural links to Rick Harris
(Rik.Harris@fulcrum.com.au) NISperl module, although the design goals were
different.  All you can do with Net::NISplusTied is to manipulate NIS+ tables.
 
If you need faithful NIS+ API implementation, consider using NISperl
instead.  The assumption was that one would rarely need to create and delete
NIS+ tables and groups from perl, at least not often enough to be seriously
inconvenienced by having to invoke shell NIS+ commands.

Thanks to SlipNet Inc. (www.slip.net) for sponsoring the development.
